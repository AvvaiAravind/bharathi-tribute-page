          At around the young age of 11, Subramanian won a Debate contest which
          was held at the court of Maharaja of Ettayapuram. Seeing young
          Subramanian debating abilities with eminent scholars, the Maharaja of
          Ettayapur conferred the title of "Bharathi". He was a pioneer of
          modern Tamil poetry and is considered one of the greatest Tamil
          literary figures of all time. He is popularly known by his mononymous
          title "Bharati/ Bharathiyaar.
        </p>
        <p>
          At the age of 15 he was married to Chellamma who was seven years old.
          He went to the M.D.T. Hindu College in Tirunelveli. Bharathi was a
          proficient linguist, he was well-versed in Tamil, Sanskrit, Hindi,
          Telugu, English, French and had a smattering knowledge of Arabic.
          During his stay in Varanasi, Bharathi was exposed to Hindu
          spirituality and nationalism. This broadened his outlook and he
          learned Sanskrit, Hindi and English.

          By April 1907, he started editing the Tamil weekly India and the
          English newspaper Bala Bharatham with M.P.T. Acharya. These newspapers
          were also a means of expressing Bharathi's creativity, which began to
          peak during this period. Bharathi started to publish his poems
          regularly in these editions. From hymns to nationalistic writings,
          from contemplations on the relationship between God and Man to songs
          on the Russian and French revolutions, Bharathi's subjects were
          diverse.

            Bharathi participated in the historic Surat Congress in 1907 along
            with V.O. Chidambaram Pillai and Mandayam Srinivachariar, which
            deepened the divisions within the Indian National Congress with a
            section preferring armed resistance, primarily led by Tilak over
            moderate approach preferred by certain other sections. Bharathi
            supported Tilak with V. O. Chidambaram Pillai and Kanchi
            Varathachariyar. Tilak openly supported armed resistance against the
            British.

          During his exile, Bharathi had the opportunity to meet many other leaders of the revolutionary wing of the Independence movement like Aurobindo, Lajpat Rai and V.V.S. Aiyar, who had also sought asylum under the French. Bharathi assisted Aurobindo in the Arya journal and later Karma Yogi in Pondicherry. This was also the period when he started learning Vedic literature. Three of his greatest works namely, Kuyil Pattu, Panchali Sapatham and Kannan Pattu were composed during 1912. He also translated Vedic hymns, Patanjali's Yoga Sutra and Bhagavat Gita to Tamil.</p> <p>
          <div>
          </p> Bharathi entered India near Cuddalore in November 1918 and was promptly arrested. He was imprisoned in the Central prison in Cuddalore in custody for three weeks from 20 November to 14 December and was released after the intervention of Annie Besant and C.P. Ramaswamy Aiyar. He was stricken by poverty during this period, resulting in his ill health. The following year, 1919, Bharathi met Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi. He resumed editing Swadesimeitran from 1920 in Madras (modern-day Chennai).
