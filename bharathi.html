          <h2>BIO</h2>
          <p>
            At around the young age of 11, Subramanian won a Debate contest
            which was held at the court of Maharaja of Ettayapuram. Seeing young
            Subramanian debating abilities with eminent scholars, the Maharaja
            of Ettayapur conferred the title of "Bharathi". He was a pioneer of
            modern Tamil poetry and is considered one of the greatest Tamil
            literary figures of all time. He is popularly known by his
            mononymous title "Bharati/ Bharathiyaar.
          </p>
          <p>
            At the age of 15 he was married to Chellamma who was seven years
            old. He went to the M.D.T. Hindu College in Tirunelveli. Bharathi
            was a proficient linguist, he was well-versed in Tamil, Sanskrit,
            Hindi, Telugu, English, French and had a smattering knowledge of
            Arabic. During his stay in Varanasi, Bharathi was exposed to Hindu
            spirituality and nationalism. This broadened his outlook and he
            learned Sanskrit, Hindi and English.

            By April 1907, he started editing the Tamil weekly India and the
            English newspaper Bala Bharatham with M.P.T. Acharya. These
            newspapers were also a means of expressing Bharathi's creativity,
            which began to peak during this period. Bharathi started to publish
            his poems regularly in these editions. From hymns to nationalistic
            writings, from contemplations on the relationship between God and
            Man to songs on the Russian and French revolutions, Bharathi's
            subjects were diverse.

            Bharathi participated in the historic Surat Congress in 1907 along
            with V.O. Chidambaram Pillai and Mandayam Srinivachariar, which
            deepened the divisions within the Indian National Congress with a
            section preferring armed resistance, primarily led by Tilak over
            moderate approach preferred by certain other sections. Bharathi
            supported Tilak with V. O. Chidambaram Pillai and Kanchi
            Varathachariyar. Tilak openly supported armed resistance against the
            British.

          <h2>Sprituality</h2>
          <p>
            Bharathi's poetry not only includes works on Hindu deities like
            Shakti, Kali, Vinayagar, Murugan, Sivan, Kannan(Krishna), but also
            on other religious gods like Allah and Jesus. His insightful similes
            have been read by millions of Tamil readers. He was well-versed in
            various languages and translated speeches of Indian National reform
            leaders like Sri Aurobindo, Bal Gangadhar Tilak and Swami
            Vivekananda. Bharathi's works can be found at Tamil Wikisource
            Subramaniya Bharathi and also at the open access Tamil literature
            repository called Project Madurai.[19] Bharathi's works were
            nationalized meaning they were brought under public ownership of the
            government thus becoming public domain works in 1949[9] by the then
            Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu, Omandur Ramasamy Reddy.

          <h2>Bharathi on Caste System</h2>
          <blockquote>
            "சாதிகள் இல்லையடி பாப்பா!-குலத் <br />தாழ்ச்சி உயர்ச்சி சொல்லல்
            பாவம்;<br />
            நீதி உயர்ந்த மதி, கல்வி-அன்பு<br />
            நிறைய உடையவர்கள் மேலோர்."
          </blockquote>
          <p>
            Bharathi also fought against the caste system in Hindu society.
            Bharathi was born in an orthodox Brahmin family, but he considered
            all living beings to be equal, and to illustrate this he performed
            the upanayanam for a young Dalit man and made him a Brahmana. He
            also scorned the divisive tendencies being imparted into the younger
            generations by their elderly tutors during his time. He openly
            criticised the preachers for mixing their individual thoughts while
            teaching the Vedas, Upanishads and the Gita. He strongly advocated
            bringing the Dalits to the Hindu mainstream. Here he expresses the
            love between human beings, where a man should not see their caste.
            They should see them as human beings. Not only human beings, they
            should see them as their brothers and sisters. This means that a
            well-educated person knows to treat them equally and not by their
            caste.

            The Government of India in 1987 instituted a highest National
            Subramanyam Bharati Award conferred along with Ministry of Human
            Resource Development, annually confers on writers of outstanding
            works in Hindi literature. Bharathiar University, a state university
            named after the poet, was established in 1982 at Coimbatore. There
            is a statue of Bharathiar at Marina Beach and also in the Indian
            Parliament. A Tamil Movie titled Bharathi was made in the year 2000
            on the life of the poet by Gnana Rajasekeran, which won National
            Film Award for Best Feature Film in Tamil. The movie Kappalottiya
            Thamizhan chronicles the important struggles of V.O.Chidambaranar

            On 14 August 2014 Professor Muhammadu Sathik raja Started an
            Educational trust at thiruppuvanam pudur, near Madurai named as Omar
            -Bharathi educational trust, the name is kept to praise the two
            legendary poets Umaru Pulavar and Subramania Bharathiyar from
            Ettaiyapuram. Though these two Poets are having three centuries time
            interval, the divine service and their contribution to the Tamil
            language are made them unparallel legends. Both two poets are
            offered their services at vaigai river bank of thiruppuvanam. the
            two poets were strongly suffered by their financial status, so both
            of them were unsuccessful to fulfil their family members need. Many
            roads are named after him, notable ones including Bharathiar road in
            Coimbatore and Subramaniam Bharti Marg in New Delhi. The NGO
